## Contributor License Agreement
By contributing you agree to the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) of this repository.

## In General
1. Please only submit *free* resources.  Email gates or free user accounts to access the resource are allowed, but not preferable, and must be disclosed.
2. We do not accept pull requests for this repo! The curated list is automatically generated from the .json file that powers [infosecstack.com](https://www.infosecstack.com). If you'd like to suggest a resource, please just open an issue and make your recommendation. We will update the .json file, and generate the update, and push the change ourselves. Please include the following information:
  - Title
  - Author (if applicable)
  - Description
  - Categeory - e.g., Ransomware
  - Type - e.g., Guides, Courses, Books, Tools
  - Price - Please indicate if premium options are available in addition to the free option
  - Gate - Please indicate if email or registration is required to access the resource
3. Because we cannot verify that resources uploaded to cloud file hosts, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. are authorized, we cannot allow links to these.  If you are the author of a resource and require a host, please contact us by opening an issue.
4. If a resource is available from multiple locations, please use the most authoritative link, e.g., the publisher's website or the author's personal webpage.
5. When submitting root domains, strip the trailing slash: `http://example.com` instead of `http://example.com/`
6. Use the shortest link: `http://example.com/dir/` is better than `http://example.com/dir/index.html`
    + no URL shortener links
7. Generally prefer the "current" link over the "version" one: `http://example.com/dir/book/current/` is better than `http://example.com/dir/book/v1.0.0/index.html`
8. Always use an `https` link instead of an `http` link, if both are available, with the exception of number 10.
9. If a link has an expired certificate/self-signed certificate/SSL issue of any other kind:
    - *replace it* with its `http` counterpart if possible (because accepting exceptions can be complicated on mobile devices)
    - *leave it* if no `http` version but link still accessible through `https` by adding an exception to the browser or ignoring the warning
    - *remove it* otherwise
